This is a sample project where I'll explore and learn a bit about ESP32, CYD, LVG_L, MQTT, and whatever else I can come up with.

There is Docker Compose file in utils/mosquitto that will spin up an instance of the [Mosquitto MQTT broker](https://mosquitto.org).

There is a [LINQPad script](https://www.linqpad.net) in utils/sample_publish.linq that will generate some random messages to be displayed on the CYD. This is an attempt to simulate "real stuff."
